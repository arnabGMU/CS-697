# CS-697
My folder structure looks like the following
  - Home_002_1
  - pc_to_wc
  - point_clouds

First, I run the generate_point_cloud.ipynb file which writes all of the point clouds file in the directory 'point_clouds'.

Then, I run the pc_to_wc.ipynb file, which writes all of the transformed point clouds in the directory 'pc_to_wc'.

visualize_point_cloud.ipynb file reads transformed point clouds from pc_to_wc folder and visualizes.

occupancy_grid.ipynb code is not complete. At this point, it uses the transformed points and using y threshold visualizes some points with color.
